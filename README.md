This code sets up a basic one-page website with:

A navbar that links to different sections of the page.
A home section with a full viewport height that includes a title and a call-to-action button.
An about section where you can talk more about space exploration.
A gallery section where you can showcase images or interesting facts about space.
A contact section for visitors to reach out.
A simple footer with copyright information.
Bootstrap's JavaScript components depend on jQuery and Popper.js, which is why they are included at the bottom of the HTML.
